Installing the classic right-click menu requires a restart.  Normally this is a reboot, but
you can go into task manager, right click on "Windows Explorer" and select `restart`

Reboot is manual - I'd like to set up a conditional for this but can't figure how

It would be nice to make the option to install the classic right click menu dependent on windows version
