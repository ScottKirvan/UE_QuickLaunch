Not Gonna Do ✓
------
- [x] something to ponder: doing this in scooterutils will let is know where the engine is located at install-time
- [x] switch Statement using 'call' - for handling of type of context click and for errors - #someday/maybe
- [x] simplify code by setting up var strings before doing the actual work - #someday/maybe
