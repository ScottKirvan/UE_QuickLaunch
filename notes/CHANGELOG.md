All notable change to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- User can now select target directory during install
- Added license text (MIT license) to installer
- QuickLaunch now supports project templates:  Add a `ue_quicklaunch_template` folder and the folder's contents will be used as a template to create your new project.  The UE_QuickLauncher looks for the `ue_quicklaunch_folder` in it's install directory.  The template's `uproject` file should be named, `ue_quicklaunch_template.uproject`.   
- By default, the installer now installs into a `UE_QuickLaunch` folder instead of `SKVFX UE_QuickLaunch`.
- More robust error checking an correction of unsupported characters in `uproject` filenames
- A shortcut to the documentation (on github) has been added.
- The installer includes a default, example UE5 template that can be installed.


## [Released]
## [2.0.1] - 2023-08-26
### Fixed
- MSI installer depended on a .cab file that wasn't downloaded with the release.  The cab is now embedded in the MSI file.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-08-16
### Added
- added an MSI installer
  - This refactors the entire project and puts it under the management of an msvc Solution.  
  - The binary resource dll is no longer included, precompiled, in the repo, it will now be packaged into a proper github release

## [1.0.3] - 2023-05-06
### Added
- The autogenerated uproject file name now tries to follow proper unreal engine standards - no spaces, no dashes, must start with an alphabetic character, etc.

## [1.0.2] - 2023-04-27
### Fixed
- I left in a pause at the end of the batch script that launches unreal.  This is nice to have for debugging and seeing what's going on, but not necessary, so I removed it.

## [1.0.1] - 2023-04-27
### Fixed
- last thing I did yesterday was add a "click on uproject" mode.  Epic Games Launcher sees the change
to how it wants those registry keys set and resets them.  I removed this feature for now -- will see if I can't figure out my own handler for this later.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-04-27
### Added
- several new feature, an installer and an uninstaller, a vscode project for a reserource-only dll, which provides a pretty icon for us, and some initial documentation
### Refactored
- tons.  Initial check-in was for safety first.

## [0.0.1] - 2023-04-26
### Added
- initial repo/template check-in
