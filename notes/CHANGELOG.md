## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2023-04-27

### Fixed

- I left in a pause at the end of the batch script that launches unreal.  This is nice to have for debugging and seeing what's going on, but not necessary, so I removed it.

## [1.0.1] - 2023-04-27

### Fixed

- last thing I did yesterday was add a "click on uproject" mode.  Epic Games Launcher sees the change
to how it wants those registry keys set and resets them.  I removed this feature for now -- will see if I can't figure out my own handler for this later.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-04-27

### Added

- several new feature, an installer and an uninstaller, a vscode project for a reserource-only dll, which provides a pretty icon for us, and some initial documentation

### Refactored

- tons.  Initial check-in was for safety first.

## [0.0.1] - 2023-04-26

### Added

- initial repo/template check-in
